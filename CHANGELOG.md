# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).


## [2.5.0]

### Added
- `autoGa: true` in `sanshain.yaml` makes a provide GA whenever the build declares trunk or a tag; `--ga=false` or `SANSHAIN_GA=false` keeps a build a snapshot.
- `annotations` in `sanshain.yaml` travel with provide, require, bundle and catalog push, their `{{NAME}}` placeholders filled from `--set NAME=value` or `SANSHAIN_SET_NAME` (needs Sanshain Service 2.13.0 or later).

### Changed
- `--ga=false` now beats `SANSHAIN_GA=true` and publishes a snapshot (before, the variable made it GA).

### Fixed
- A require with `apiType: grpc` goes to `/require/grpc` and is saved as `.proto`, and its bundle sends `api_type: proto`; it went to `/require` and was saved as `.yaml`.
